# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with an introduction to the most basic features of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) core.

**Thoughts:** Plan to build a Typing test application using Vue.js. I have good experience in React.js and wanted to try out Vue.js.
